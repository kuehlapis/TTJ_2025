  "reasoning": "The features described, 'Mood-based PF enhancements' and 'New user rewards via NR profile suggestions', do not directly violate the obligations or prohibitions outlined in SB-976. SB-976 primarily focuses on parental control mechanisms, restrictions on addictive feeds and notifications for minors, and transparency requirements. These features do not inherently create addictive feeds or target minors specifically.",
  "potential_violations": "N/A",
  "evidence": "N/A",
  "recommendations": "While the features don't directly violate SB-976, it's recommended to ensure that any mood-based personalization or profile suggestions do not disproportionately affect minors or create addictive experiences. Implement age-appropriate design principles and consider the potential impact on minors' well-being.",
