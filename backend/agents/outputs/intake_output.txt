Response:
Curfew login blocker with ASL (Age-sensitive logic) and GH (Geo-handler; a module responsible for routing features based on user region) for Utah minors.To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL (Age-sensitive logic) to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH (Geo-handler; a module responsible for routing features based on user region) to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace (Log tracing mode to verify compliance routing) for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode (Deploy feature in non-user-impact way to collect analytics only) during initial rollout.
